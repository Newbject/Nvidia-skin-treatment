# Nvidia AI Skin Disease Detection

 This project is meant for quick detection of skin diseases(Acne, Carcinoma, Eczema, Keratosis, Milia, Rosacea) and giving a link on how to treat it. This program can be helpful in many cases. for example, when it's midnight and you find a part of your skin red, and rather than searching the internet, can give you instant results on how to treat it.
